Team Members
Ron Vera - Project Lead and Designer
Patrick Johnston - Architect lead and developer
Carlos Carpio - Developer and QA Analyst

This projectâ€™s goal is to deliver a mobile app to find food trucks near your vicinity using
GPS that also provides a menu, and the ability to place orders for pick-up. This product is
for the foodie that quickly and efficiently want to locate various food trucks in the area. It
will be a sleek user-friendly interface with reviews from other users, a calendar with your
favorite food trucks schedule and listing of any food truck events. This app will serve
everyone from students, people looking where to have lunch break at work, or people out
in the evening with friends. 
We will launch on iOS and eventually port it to Android and Windows. Devices will need
GPS for its main functionality. 

This github provides:

1. Documentation for the project, including the proposal, SRS, and SAS.
2. Mockups for the app user interface.
3. Midterm and final presentation slides.
